# DriveCleaner
DriveCleaner.ps1 is a lightweight and effective PowerShell script designed to help you clean up temporary files, log files, and backup files from any folder on your system.
It scans the specified folder for files with extensions .tmp, .log, and .bak, lists them with their sizes, and asks for your confirmation before deleting.
After cleaning, it generates a detailed HTML report of all deleted files for your review.

This script is useful for freeing up disk space and improving system performance by removing unnecessary temporary files.
